      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a professional IT employee and a lifelong fan of MS Dhoni. My journey as an MSDian began in 2005, when I came home after playing cricket and saw my father watching a match on TV. I don’t remember the exact match, but I still recall seeing a long-haired player smashing big shots with incredible confidence — that was the moment MS Dhoni caught my eye.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time, I had just started using an Android phone, and I remember finishing all my mobile balance just to download his photos. What started as admiration quickly became a passion. Over the years, this turned into a hobby, and today, I’ve proudly collected over 65,000 photos and videos of MS Dhoni — and the collection continues to grow. This fan page is an extension of that passion. It’s my way of giving back to the fan community and keeping Dhoni’s spirit and legacy alive — not just for myself, but for everyone who calls themselves an MSDian.
