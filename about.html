      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a professional IT employee and a lifelong fan of MS Dhoni. My journey as an MSDian began in <strong>2005</strong>, when I came home after playing cricket and saw my father watching a match on TV. I don’t remember the exact match, but I still recall seeing a long-haired player smashing big shots with incredible confidence — that was the moment MS Dhoni caught my eye.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before that, I admired legends like Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar, but from that day forward, my heart belonged to Dhoni.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time, I had just started using an Android phone, and I remember finishing all my mobile balance just to download his photos. What started as admiration quickly became a passion. Over the years, this turned into a hobby, and today, I’ve proudly collected over <strong>65,000</strong> photos and videos of MS Dhoni — and the collection continues to grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        This fan page is an extension of that passion. It’s my way of giving back to the fan community and keeping Dhoni’s spirit and legacy alive — not just for myself, but for everyone who calls themselves an MSDian.
